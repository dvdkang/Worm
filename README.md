When the worm gets to the edge of the game, the game stops and a message pops up asking you to press any key to exit the window.

Not only will the game end when the worm hits the edge of the window, the game also ends when the worm hits its own body.

Playing the game, the code randomly generates apples across the window and we can see that everytime the worm eats an apple, the score increases by one and the size of the worm increments by one as well. This will continue to run until the worm either hits the edges of the window or its own body.

We can also press the 'q' key if we want to quit the game.
